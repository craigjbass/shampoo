shampoo
=======

JSON RESTful API Scaffolder &amp; End-point reference generator using json-schema.org

Based loosely on SOAP envelope xmlns declarations, without being prescriptive in the use of shampoo on either the client or server. 

The goal is to speed up development time with RESTful API endpoints that use JSON.
